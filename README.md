# 16n

Once upon a time, Sean Hellfritsch and Brian Crabtree [made a faderbank][linespost].

**16n** is the revised version of that object: it is open-source and ready for you to make, modify, or hack. 

It is currently at version **1.31**.

# Repository contents

* `firmware` is the Teensy source code.
* `electronics` is schematics and gerber files for the PCB.
* `panel` is SVG/DXF files for top and bottom panels.
* `build` is build documentation.
* `browser_test` is a webpage you can use in Google Chrome to test your 16n
  using WebMIDI.

## 16n Details

* 16 60mm faders
* sixteen CCs over USB-midi
* sixten CCs over minijack midi (with switch to swap between standards)
* sixteen 0-5V CV output jacks, one per channel.
* I2C: monome-style I2C protocol over TRS (tip is SDA, ring is SCL), works with Monome Teletype; also, I2C MASTER mode, works with monome Ansible, ER-301, TXo, etc (may require firmware patching or modification to connected device).
* Same width and similar height to monome 128 grid.

Power from 5V micro-usb into Teensy on left-hand side, or from your computer.

Toggle switch allows you to swap between 'Arturia/Novation' (tip is current source) and 'Korg/Makenoise' (ring is current source) standards; board is labelled such.

## Give us a picture, then

Here's a prototype board with the case off.

##Â Usage

### USB MIDI

Connect USB to computer or other USB host. Faders 1-16 transmit MIDI CC data on CCs 32-47, channel 1. This can be altered in firmware configuration.

### TRS MIDI

Connect USB to computer/USB host, or a USB power supply. Set toggle switch to appropriate MIDI standard. Connect TRS midi converter to MIDI port. (If you have a TRS socket on your MIDI device, you can just use a 3.5mm TRS-TRS cable). Faders 1-16 transmit MIDI CC data on CCs 32-47, channel 1. This can be altered in firmware configuration. 

### CV

Connect USB to computer/USB host, or a USB power supply. Faders 1-16 emit 0-~5V out of their relevant jacks. Connect jack sockets to _inputs_ on your synthesizer. Do **not** connect jack sockets to _outputs_ on your Eurorack system; there is power protection on the Teensy, impedence resistors on the sockets, but damage may occur if you do so.

### I2C

I2C is complex. 

By default, things are setup to work with a monome Teletype. Connect the I2C socket (tip SDA, ring SCL) to your Teletype's I2C (`II`) bus. Further instructions can be found somewhere on the internet.

To emit I2C data to TXo, Ansible, or ER-301, flash the board with firmware where `MASTER` is enabled. If you need pull-up resistors on your I2C line, fit them on the 16n circuitboard. Connect I2C lines before powering up your system. Supply power to 16n and your modular system. I2C should be transmitted for fader moves.

## BOM

[Available on Octopart][octobom]; a CSV version is in `electronics/bom-csv.csv`

Most parts you can get from eg. Mouser. I recommend buying PJ-302 jacks from [Thonk](https://thonk.co.uk) as an alternative to the more expensive CUI parts. If in doubt, 1% 0805 resistors of any manufacturer will do; caps are X7R with appropriate voltage tolerance.
