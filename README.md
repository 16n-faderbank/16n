# Sixteen-N Faderbank, minijack-MIDI version

Derived from [this post on lines][linespost], but adding a minijack connection to facilitate MIDI out. 

Toggle switch allows you to swap between 'Arturia/Novation' (tip is current source) and 'Korg' (ring is current source) standards; board is labelled such.

Implementation of hardware MIDI out and code is left to the reader; the two resistors and jack should be all you need - you only need an optocoupler for MIDI in.

## Current status

Completely untested.

## Credits

Based on work by [Brian Crabtree][tehn] and Sean Hellfritsch.
