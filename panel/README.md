# 16n: panels

* `16n-panel-drawing.pdf` is a mechanical drawing of the upper panel. Note that it's drawn with countersinks for a metal panel, but does not necessarily require them. All mounting holes are M2.5, all countersinks are 5.5mm.
* `16n-125-top.dxf` and `16n-125-bottom.dxf` are the two panels, as exported from CAD software.
* `16n-125-top.svg` and `16n-125-bottom.svg` are the same files, converted to SVG.

If you need to check dimensions when you import these files into your graphics program of choice, the mechanical drawing is good reference: the panel should be 254mm across its longest dimension, edge to edge.
