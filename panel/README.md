# 16n: panels

- `16n-132-bottom-drawing.pdf` and `16n-132-top-drawing.pdf` are mechanical drawings of the upper and lower panels. Note that they are drawn with countersinks for a metal panel, but do not necessarily require them. All mounting holes are M2.5, all countersinks are 5.5mm.
- `16n-132-top.dxf` and `16n-132-bottom.dxf` are the two panels, as exported from CAD software.
- `16n-132-top.dxf` and `16n-132-bottom.dxf` are the two panels, as exported from CAD software.
- `16n-132-top.fpd` and `16n-132-bottom.fpd` are the two panels, for Schroff's _Front Panel Designer_ software. M2.5 hardware, with countersinks.

If you need to check dimensions when you import these files into your graphics program of choice, the mechanical drawing is good reference: the panel should be 254mm across its longest dimension, edge to edge.
