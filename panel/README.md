# 16n panels

Two panels in here:

* `16n-final-panel-min-sized.dxf` is a minimal panel - it adds a small margin to the edge of the PCB size and that's it. 
* `16n-final-grid-sized-panel.dxf` is a little larger but should have *exactly* the same dimensions as a 2015+ monome 128 grid.

Holes for six standoffs and for two screws on each fader are marked; you don't need to cut every fader-screw hole.

To make a base, just remove all the inner cuts, leaving the outline and the six holes.
