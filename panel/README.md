# 16n: panels

- `16n-132-bottom-drawing.pdf` and `16n-132-top-drawing.pdf` are mechanical drawings of the upper and lower panels. Note that they are drawn with countersinks for a metal panel, but do not necessarily require them. All mounting holes are M2.5, all countersinks are 5.5mm.
- `16n-132-top.dxf` and `16n-132-bottom.dxf` are the two panels, as exported from CAD software.

If you need to check dimensions when you import these files into your graphics program of choice, the mechanical drawing is good reference: the panel should be 254mm across its longest dimension, edge to edge.
