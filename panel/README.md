# 16n: panels

- `16n-134-top.dxf` and `16n-134-bottom.dxf` are the two panels, as exported from the CAD tools they were designed in. These should be the files you make your panel from if at all possible.
- `16n-134-top.fpd` and `16n-134-bottom.fpd` are the two panels in the correct format for Schroff's _Front Panel Designer_ software. M2.5 hardware, with countersinks.
- `16n-134-top.pdf` and `16n-134-bottom.pdf` are the two panels at life-size in PDF format, with a very, very fine stroke - suitable for laser-cutting. Be sure to check the dimensions of the files in your laser-cutting platform before you start cutting.
- `16n-134-bottom-drawing.pdf` and `16n-134-top-drawing.pdf` **are mechanical drawings** of the upper and lower panels. Note that they are drawn with countersinks for a metal panel, but do not necessarily require them. All mounting holes are M2.5, all countersinks are 5.5mm. As mechanical drawings, you should **not** use these as files to send to CNC; they are purely for visual reference.

If you need to check dimensions when you import these files into your graphics program of choice, the mechanical drawing is good reference: the panel should be 254mm across its longest dimension, edge to edge.
