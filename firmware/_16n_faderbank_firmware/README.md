# 16n Firmware

Written for Teensy 3.2.

## Requirements

- Latest Teensyduino install.
- `ResponsiveAnalogRead` library
- `CD74HC4067` library

## Compilation

- You **must** compile this with Tools->USB type set to **MIDI**. (**Serial+MIDI** may have issues with certain devices you connect to).
- Be sure that the board speed is set to 120mhz (overclock) for maximum repsonsiveness.
- If you're having issues compiling related to MIDI libraries or code: make sure your Arduino `libraries` folder doesn't have any old versions of weird MIDI libraries in. The MIDI library should be installed by default via Teensyduino; otherwise, if you have the latest version of the 47effects MIDI library in your Libraries Manager, that'll also behave. It turns out that older versions in the legacy `libraries` folder sometimes lead to conflicts.

## Customisation and configuration

As of 16n firmware 2.0.0, you no longer should do ANY configuration through the Arduino IDE. All configuration is conducted from a web browser, using the [16n editor].

When you upgrade to 2.0.0 you will LOSE ANY CONFIGURATION YOU HAVE. This is a one-time thing; apologies.

The 16n will be initialised to factory defaults. Once this is done, connect over USB, and go to the [editor] in Google Chrome; you will be able to see the current configuration, edit the configuration, and transmit the new config to your device.

Note that if you do change any config related to I2C, you should power-cycle the 16n before it will be picked up.

Some options remain in `config.h`; they are primarily for developers.

In `config.h`

```C
#define DEBUG 1
```

will log debug messages to the serial port.

```C
#define DEV 1
```

will restrict the faderbank to its first channel. Designed for breadboard development; almost certainly not of interest.

## I2C MASTER MODE

MASTER MODE supports up to 4 TXo modules and/or up to 4 Ansible devices and/or 1 ER-301.

If you want to use 16n with an ER-301, you need to turn MASTER MODE on. If you want to use it with a Monome Teletype, leave you want MASTER MODE off - leave it commented out.

## Memory Map

Configuration is stored in the first 80 bytes of the on-board EEPROM. It looks like this:

Addresses 0-15 are reserved for configuration flags/data.

FADERMAX and FADERMIN are 14-bit numbers; as such, they are stored in two bytes as MSB and LSB; the actual number is calculated by `(MSB << 8) + LSB`
