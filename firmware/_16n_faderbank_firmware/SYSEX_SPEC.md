# 16n Sysex spec

The 16n interfaces with its editor via MIDI Sysex. This document describes the supported messages.

## `0x1F` - "1nFo"

Request for 16n to transmit current state via sysex. No other payload.

## `0x0F` - "c0nFig"

"Here is my current config." Only sent by 16n as an outbound message, in response to `0x1F`. Payload of 80 bytes, describing current EEPROM state.

## `0x0E` - "c0nfig Edit"

"Here is a new complete configuration for you". Payload (other than mfg header, top/tail, etc) of 80 bytes to go straight into EEPROM, according to the memory map described in `README.md`.

## `0x0D` - "c0nfig edit (Device options)"

"Here is a new set of device options for you". Payload (other than mfg header, top/tail, etc) of 16 bytes to go straight into appropriate locations of EEPROM, according to the memory map described in `README.md`.

## `0x0C` - "c0nfig edit (usb options)"

"Here is a new set of USB options for you". Payload (other than mfg header, top/tail, etc) of 32 bytes to go straight into appropriate locations of EEPROM, according to the memory map described in `README.md`.

## `0x0B` - "c0nfig edit (trs options)"

"Here is a new set of TRS options for you". Payload (other than mfg header, top/tail, etc) of 32 bytes to go straight into appropriate locations of EEPROM, according to the memory map described in `README.md`.

### PENDING

## `0x1A` - "1nitiAlize memory"

"Wipe the EEPROM and force factory settings". Unlikely to ever be needed. The use case is "emptying" the EEPROM of a Teensy that's previously been used for other projects, and thus has an inaccurate configuration on it.
